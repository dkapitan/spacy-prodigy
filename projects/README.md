# Project templates

[spaCy projects](https://spacy.io/usage/projects) let you manage and share **end-to-end spaCy workflows** for different **use cases and domains**, and orchestrate training, packaging and serving your custom pipelines. You can start off by cloning a pre-defined project template, adjust it to fit your needs, load in your data, train a pipeline, export it as a Python package, upload your outputs to a remote storage and share your results with your team.

> ⚠️ spaCy project templates require [**spaCy v3**](https://spacy.io). You can
> install it from pip with `pip install spacy` or conda with `conda install spacy -c conda-forge`. Make sure to use a fresh virtual environment.
